            🤖 Bleep bloop, I'm a bot 🤖
            I was instructed to provide links to CI builds, so here they are for
            [armv7hl](https://gitlab.com/#{project_path}/-/jobs/artifacts/#{resource['source_branch']}/browse?job=build:armv7hl),
            [aarch64](https://gitlab.com/#{project_path}/-/jobs/artifacts/#{resource['source_branch']}/browse?job=build:aarch64),
            and
            [i486](https://gitlab.com/#{project_path}/-/jobs/artifacts/#{resource['source_branch']}/browse?job=build:i486)
            .
            Just click through `target` ➡️ your architecture ➡️ `release` ➡️ `rpmbuild` ➡️ `RPMS` ➡️ another architecture, and you'll have an `.rpm`!
            Don't forget to revert to OpenRepos after your testing, because you will not receive updates until two new versions appear!

            These builds are only available and up-to-date when the ![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/#{project_path}/badges/#{resource['source_branch']}/pipeline.svg) is green!

            🤖 Bleep bloop, I'm a bot 🤖
            I was instructed to provide links to CI builds, but I currenty do not have the ability to do this when the source project doesn't equal the target project. Panda is truly sorry! ☹️ 🐼
